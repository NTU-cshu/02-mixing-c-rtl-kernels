INFO: [HW-EMU 01] Hardware emulation runs simulation underneath. Using a large data set will result in long simulation times. It is recommended that a small dataset is used for faster execution. The flow uses approximate models for Global memories and interconnect and hence the performance data generated is approximate.
INFO: [HW-EMU 07-0] Please refer the path "/mnt/HLSNAS/04.fOjdzH/Vitis-Tutorials/Hardware_Acceleration/Feature_Tutorials/02-mixing-c-rtl-kernels/reference-files/.run/1570637/hw_em/device0/binary_0/behav_waveform/xsim/simulate.log" for more detailed simulation infos, errors and warnings.
